### Our covered domains include:
- Statistical Machine Learning (Classification & Regression)
- Computer Vision
- NLP & Sentiment Analysis
- Time Series Analysis
- Generative AI with Pretrained Models
  
You can dive deep into your selected area without worrying about unrelated concepts from other domains. This specificity will save time and enhance your expertise in the chosen field. Best of luck 😊
